**Education**

This June, I will graduate from the [University of Saskatchewan](http://www.usask.ca)
with a B.Sc. Honours in Computer Science
and a B.Sc. 4-year in Mathematics.

In September, I'll be starting a Masters degree in Computing Science
at the [University of Utrecht](http://www.uu.nl).

**Academic Interests**

My areas of interest include formal languages, theory of computation, and functional/logical programming.
My main languages of development are [Haskell](http://haskell.org), [SWI-Prolog](http://swi-prolog.org/), [Python](http://python.org)
and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org).
I've also completed projects in C, Java, Scheme, and Standard ML.

In addition to taking classes, I am actively involved in research for my Honours Thesis. My current research focuses around the shuffle operator on words in Formal Language Theory.

**Personal**

I was born and raised in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

In the past, I was the president of the 
[University of Saskatchewan Debate Society](http://usask.ca/debate),
and I've competed at several regional and national tournaments in [CUSID](http://cusid.ca).
