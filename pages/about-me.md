My name is Joey Eremondi, an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan.

My areas of interest include Algorithmics, Formal Language Theory, Functional/Logical Programming, and Cryptography.

In addition to taking classes, I am actively involved in research for my Honours Thesis. My current research focuses around the shuffle operator on words in Formal Language Theory.
